Solving challanges on [Code Crafters](https://app.codecrafters.io)

When working with a challange you use git to push to their site to pass the challange. So in this repo I am uploading a copy of each finished challange, to avoid nested git repos. Because I have not found a way to share my code from their own site. They themself suggest that I would have created one repo per challange, but I want all challangs collected under one repo.
